## General Information
- Surprise Housing company has collected data with various features. Linear Regression model has been developed to analyze and predict price of the houses.
- Surprise Housing company is entering Australian market and hence the model has selected few features that will affect the Sale Price of the houses. The company can utilize this details and make strategic decision using these features to make best profit in housing business.
- The model uses Linear Regression, Ridge and Lasso regression regularization is applied to provide best predictive analysis.
- The model uses train.csv data set which has the data collected by Surprise Housing company to analyze the Australian market.
